# Full System Compromise: Core Forum Exploitation Chain

## 🎯 Objective
Infiltrate a malicious hacker forum by exploiting file upload vulnerabilities, establishing persistent access, and escalating privileges.

## 🔍 Attack Surface Analysis
- **Primary Vector**: File upload functionality with insufficient validation
- **Protection Bypass**: Server configuration override technique
- **Target System**: Forum application running Apache/PHP

## 💥 Multi-Stage Exploitation

### Stage 1: File Upload Bypass
- **Vulnerability**: Incomplete file extension filtering
- **Bypass Method**: Upload server configuration file with custom handlers
- **Web Shell**: Code disguised to bypass content checks
- **Verification**: Direct access to uploaded file with command parameter

### Stage 2: Reverse Shell Establishment
- **Challenge**: Restricted command execution environment
- **Solution**: Alternative shell techniques using available system utilities
- **Payload Delivery**: Command execution via web shell parameter
- **Access Achieved**: Low-privilege user shell with interactive access

### Stage 3: Privilege Escalation
- **Discovery**: Misconfigured system binary with elevated permissions
- **Exploitation**: Programming language feature to assume elevated identity
- **Result**: Full administrative access to underlying operating system

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies
1. **Configuration Hardening**: Restrict server configuration modifications
2. **File Upload Security**: Extension whitelisting, content verification, random naming
3. **System Binary Audit**: Regular review and removal of unnecessary elevated permissions
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Web server should run with minimal necessary rights

## 📊 Skills Demonstrated
- **Advanced Bypass Techniques**: Server configuration manipulation
- **Post-Exploitation**: Shell stabilization, environment enumeration
- **Privilege Escalation**: Identification and exploitation of misconfigured system binaries
- **Full Attack Chain**: External web vulnerability to complete system compromise
