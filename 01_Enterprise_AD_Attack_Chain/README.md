# 🎯 Professional Demonstration: Enterprise AD Attack Chain

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the methodology and technical proficiency required to execute a full-scope Active Directory compromise, from external reconnaissance to domain dominance. The work synthesizes knowledge from hands-on lab assessments into a professional framework that highlights attack path analysis, tooling, and business-risk communication.

**Key Demonstration Points:**
*   **Systematic Methodology:** A repeatable process for assessing enterprise AD security.
*   **Technical Depth:** Practical application of advanced techniques like Kerberos abuse and ADCS exploitation.
*   **Professional Context:** Findings are analyzed for business impact and translated into clear remediation guidance.

## 🔧 Demonstrated Technical Skills
*   **Reconnaissance:** Passive/active information gathering, DNS analysis, LDAP enumeration.
*   **Initial Access:** Kerberos-based credential attacks (AS-REP Roasting).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Abuse of Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) misconfigurations.
*   **Post-Exploitation:** Credential harvesting, lateral movement, and virtualization layer targeting.
*   **Tool Proficiency:** Impacket suite, BloodHound, ADCS exploitation tools, offensive PowerShell/Python.
