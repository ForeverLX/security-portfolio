# 🎯 Professional Demonstration: Enterprise AD Attack Chain

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the methodology and technical proficiency required to execute a full-scope Active Directory compromise, from external reconnaissance to domain dominance. The work synthesizes knowledge from hands-on lab assessments into a professional framework that highlights attack path analysis, tooling, and business-risk communication.

Professional Context & Business Impact: This simulation was conducted with a client-focused mindset. The methodology emphasizes not just technical exploitation, but business impact analysis that ties findings to organizational risk (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS implications), clear remediation guidance for blue teams, and professional documentation suitable for both executive and technical audiences. This approach transforms technical vulnerabilities into actionable business intelligence.

**Key Demonstration Points:**
*   **Systematic Methodology:** A repeatable process for assessing enterprise AD security.
*   **Technical Depth:** Practical application of advanced techniques like Kerberos abuse and ADCS exploitation.
*   **Professional Context:** Findings are analyzed for business impact and translated into clear remediation guidance.

## 📈 Professional Approach & Business Impact
This project was executed with a **client-engagement mindset**, mirroring the workflow of a professional security consultant. The methodology prioritizes:
*   **Business Risk Translation:** Technical findings are analyzed for their potential impact on operations, data confidentiality, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).
*   **Actionable Remediation:** Each phase of the attack chain is documented with clear, prioritized defensive steps that blue teams can implement.
*   **Stakeholder-Aligned Deliverables:** The process culminates in a structured report containing an executive summary for leadership and technical details for engineers, demonstrating the ability to communicate across all levels of an organization.

This approach ensures the work provides tangible security improvement, not just proof of compromise.

## 🔧 Demonstrated Technical Skills
*   **Reconnaissance:** Passive/active information gathering, DNS analysis, LDAP enumeration.
*   **Initial Access:** Kerberos-based credential attacks (AS-REP Roasting).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Abuse of Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) misconfigurations.
*   **Post-Exploitation:** Credential harvesting, lateral movement, and virtualization layer targeting.
*   **Tool Proficiency:** Impacket suite, BloodHound, ADCS exploitation tools, offensive PowerShell/Python.
