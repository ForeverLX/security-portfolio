# From Technical Finding to Business Risk
A key professional skill is translating technical vulnerabilities into business terms.
| Technical Finding | Potential Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Credential Compromise** | Unauthorized access to customer data, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines (GDPR, PCI-DSS). |
| **Privilege Escalation Paths** | Full domain compromise. Attacker can disable security controls and access every system. |
| **Secrets & Credential Storage** | Catastrophic lateral movement. Compromise of one server leads to exposure of infrastructure credentials. |
