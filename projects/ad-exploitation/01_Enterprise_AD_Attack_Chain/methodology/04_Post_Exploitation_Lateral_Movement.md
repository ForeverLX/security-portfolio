# Phase 4: Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement
## Objective
Leverage obtained Domain Administrator privileges to harvest credentials and move to critical infrastructure.
## Core Techniques
1.  **Credential Harvesting & DCSync:** Extract password hashes for all domain users, enabling persistent access.
2.  **Lateral Movement to Virtualization Infrastructure:** Target hypervisor management using discovered credentials to control the virtual environment.
## Security & Business Impact Consolidation
*   **Technical Impact:** Full control over identity (AD), data (on VMs), and applications.
*   **Business Impact:** Enables catastrophic ransomware deployment and mass data exfiltration.
*   **Root Cause:** Often poor credential segregation and insecure secret storage.
