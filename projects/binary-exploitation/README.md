# Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering

## Competitive & Academic Proof
This section documents my progression in low-level security through competitive platforms and academic-style education.

### 🏆 StackSmash Ranking: 3rd of 204
[StackSmash](https://stacksmash.net/) is a competitive binary exploitation and reverse engineering platform. My ranking in the top 1.5% demonstrates practical skills in:
*   Memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format strings)
*   Modern exploit mitigations (ASLR, NX, Stack Canaries)
*   Reliable exploit development with ROP chains

**Verification:** [Public Ranking Link or Screenshot Coming Soon]

### 📚 pwn.college Completion
Completed core curricula at Arizona State University's pwn.college:
*   **Linux Luminarium (128/128):** Command-line mastery, filesystem permissions, process manipulation
*   **x86 Assembly Crash Course (30/30):** Registers, memory addressing, control flow, system calls

**Skills Validated:** Systematic approach to security fundamentals, ability to learn complex low-level concepts.
