# pwn.college: GDB Debugging & Reverse Engineering

## 🎯 Curriculum Overview
Developed professional-grade debugging and reverse engineering skills through hands-on challenges using GDB for dynamic analysis, memory inspection, and runtime manipulation.

## 📚 Core Debugging Skills

### GDB Proficiency
- **Memory Examination**: Using `x/<n><u><f>` command for precise memory inspection
- **Breakpoint Management**: Setting conditional and unconditional breakpoints
- **Execution Control**: Stepping, continuing, and finishing function execution
- **Register Inspection**: Monitoring and modifying CPU register state

### Advanced Techniques
- **Scripted Debugging**: Automating analysis with GDB scripts and `.gdbinit` configuration
- **Runtime Modification**: Altering program state during execution
- **System Call Interception**: Modifying arguments to system calls dynamically
- **Data Structure Analysis**: Inspecting complex memory layouts

## 🔬 Challenge Solutions

### Memory Analysis Patterns
- **Stack Frame Analysis**: Identifying local variables, parameters, and return addresses
- **Heap Inspection**: Examining dynamically allocated memory regions
- **Code Disassembly**: Using `disassemble` and `layout regs` for code analysis
- **String Extraction**: Locating and extracting ASCII and binary data from memory

### Dynamic Program Manipulation
- **Register Modification**: Changing register values to alter program behavior
- **Memory Patching**: Overwriting instructions and data in running processes
- **Condition Bypass**: Modifying comparison results to force specific code paths
- **Function Call Interception**: Changing arguments and return values

### Automated Analysis
- **Breakpoint Commands**: Executing GDB commands automatically when breakpoints hit
- **Hook Functions**: Using `hook-run` and `hook-stop` for automated setup
- **Python Scripting**: Leveraging GDB's Python API for complex analysis
- **Watchpoints**: Monitoring memory locations for changes

## 💡 Technical Insights

### Debugger Internals
- **Process Control**: How debuggers attach to and control target processes
- **Signal Handling**: Managing traps, breakpoints, and other signals
- **Memory Spaces**: Understanding address space layout and memory protection
- **Symbol Resolution**: Loading and using debug symbols for enhanced analysis

### Reverse Engineering Methodology
- **Systematic Analysis**: Structured approach to understanding unknown binaries
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Forming and testing theories about program behavior
- **State Tracking**: Maintaining mental model of program state during execution
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common code patterns and compiler idioms

## 🛠️ Security Applications
