# 🔓 Darrius Grate | Offensive Security Portfolio

**OWASP Las Vegas Leader | Top 1.5% StackSmash | AD Red Team & Vulnerability Research**

## 🎯 Who I Am
I am transitioning from physical to technical security through systematic, evidence-based skill development. My approach combines **competitive binary exploitation rankings** with **professional-grade red team methodology**, demonstrating the rare ability to operate across both low-level systems and enterprise environments.

## 📈 What I Deliver
I bridge the gap between technical execution and business risk. I don't just find vulnerabilities—I document how they impact organizations, providing clear remediation that security teams can actually implement.
