# 🔓 Darrius Grate | Offensive Security Portfolio

**OWASP Las Vegas Leader | Top 1.5% StackSmash | AD Red Team & Vulnerability Research**

## 🎯 Who I Am

I am transitioning from physical to technical security through systematic, evidence-based skill development. My approach combines **competitive binary exploitation rankings** with **professional-grade red team methodology**, demonstrating the rare ability to operate across both low-level systems and enterprise environments.

## 📈 What I Deliver

I bridge the gap between technical execution and business risk. I don't just find vulnerabilities—I document how they impact organizations, providing clear remediation that security teams can actually implement.

## 📜 Professional Artifacts & Approach

- **Client-Ready Reporting:** I produce deliverables with executive summaries, technical details mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and actionable remediation roadmaps.
- **Business Impact Analysis:** I translate technical findings into organizational risk, considering compliance (GDPR, PCI-DSS) and potential business disruption.
- **Operational Realism:** My work documents troubleshooting and adaptation in constrained environments, not just scripted success.
- **Web Application Security:** Through 60+ CAPT certification labs, I've demonstrated hands-on proficiency across the OWASP Top 10 in practical scenarios.
